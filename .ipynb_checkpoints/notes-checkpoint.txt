This papers architecture contains about 8 layers: 5 convolutional layers and 3 dense connected layers
the image contains 256x256 dimension
the final activation function is softmax which outputs a probability of all the activation functions
response normalization layer only applies to 1st and 2nd conolutional layers
maxpooling layers are applied after response normalization layer and after 5th convolutional layer
maxpooling+normalization+CNN form 1 full convolutional layer which applies to the  first and second only
apply relu to every convolutional layer and fully connected layers
The 3 fully-connected layers have 4096 neurons each.
