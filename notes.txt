This papers architecture contains about 8 layers: 5 convolutional layers and 3 dense connected layers
the image contains 256x256 dimension

The final activation function is softmax which outputs a probability of all the activation functions.
Response normalization layer only applies to 1st and 2nd convolutional layers.

Maxpooling+normalization+CNN form 1 full convolutional layer which applies to the  first and second only

Maxpooling layers are applied after response normalization layer and after 5th convolutional layer

Apply relu to every convolutional layer and fully connected layers
The 3 fully-connected layers have 4096 neurons each.
